> ## 📱 PHASE/IOS-FIX1 — on-device iOS-16 shakeout (sprint-12): **16 owner-reported issues → 4-cluster diagnosis → 6 slices + 1 process ticket — ALL 6 SLICES DONE · PHASE GATE PASS · PR DRAFTED** (2026-07-03, `phase/ios-fix1`, 11 commits pushed; **remaining acceptance: the OWNER DEVICE PASS**)
>
> **The device-verification phase.** The owner tested BOTH iOS apps on a real **iOS 16** iPhone for the first
> time and reported **16 issues**; a 4-cluster diagnosis (**booking-ux · brand-assets · navigation-shell ·
> data-layer**, 2026-07-02) grounded ALL of them with file:line evidence — the diagnosis workflow is
> **verified** (every finding cause-rooted, several empirically reproduced on a booted iOS 16.4 simulator, the
> "non-optional field" suspicion DISPROVEN by an executed decode test). **Key structural lesson:** the
> crash/⚠️/island defects were **invisible on the latest-runtime simulator** (iOS 17+ nav-authority rework +
> system tab-bar styling masked them) and the brand misses were invisible to a gate whose citation unit is the
> `.kt` screen file — hence the T-0374 process ticket. **T-0314 addendum below: feature-complete ≠
> device-verified — this phase is the device-verification debt.** Filed **T-0368…T-0374** (each ticket embeds
> its cluster's evidence):

> | **T-0368** | **A** | **Customer shell RESTRUCTURE** — single shell `NavigationStack` + page-style pager + the custom pill-bar/FAB composite; fixes the iOS-16 `comparisonTypeMismatch` **CRASH** (Plus route), the yellow-⚠️ placeholder pushes, the never-ported island bar, the FAB overlap/Rewards clipping, and tab-swipe parity. iOS-16-specific, **SHIP-BLOCKER**. **Architect ruling IN FLIGHT** (changes the ADR-0020 customer-shell pattern; fallback = minimal outer-stack delete + `NavigationPath` conversion) | M | **done ✅** `d34eaf5e` (ruling ACCEPTED as **ADR-0022** `987f85f0`; reviewer workflow-verified, findings ROUTED → folded in `fef5745c`; 16.4 smoke 0 NavigationAuthority/comparisonTypeMismatch hits; signed-in walk = owner device pass) | — | architect, ios | no | — | navigation-shell (+ the nested-stack finding of data-layer) |

> | **T-0370** | **C** | **Data-layer fixes** — `MembershipStatus` `[SwaggerEnumAsInt]` + spec re-dump + BOTH-client regen + the Android `IntEnumSerializersModule` entry (the contract lie kills `GetMyMembership` for any subscribed user, both platforms); `apiResponseQueue` off main (both apps) + parallel prefetch (the "lag"); offset-less date-decoder hardening; `ApiError.fromGenerated` → ProblemDetails code extraction (24/25 call sites showed raw JSON — **ABSORBS T-0367**) | M | **done ✅** `5252bfb9`+fold `ebf2fcfd` (reviewer PASSED on substance, 3 test/guard CHANGES folded red→green; **the manual steps ran IN-BRANCH** — disposable-postgres spec re-dump + Kotlin client regen, Android compile green, iOS client CI-regenerated; dotnet **1714/1714** incl. `MobileSpecEnumGuardTests` pinning every mobile enum schema to integer; closes T-0367) | — | backend, ios, android | no | **owner: VERIFY the committed spec diff at the PR (or re-run `scripts/refresh-mobile-spec.sh` + regens) — executed in-branch, see the ticket's AC2 deviation** | data-layer |
> | **T-0371** | **D** | **Booking wizard UX** — SlideToConfirm was NEVER implemented (static + tap w/ silent guard) → hoist the partner's working control to `CleansiaCore` + `resetTrigger`; in-sheet snackbar host (the root host is occluded by EVERY modal sheet — also promo/referral/Stripe-cancel) + `.profileIncomplete` → dismiss+edit-profile (Android parity); `BookingViewModel` hoisted out of the sheet so the draft survives dismissal. Serialize `CustomerShellView.swift` edits with T-0368 | M | **done ✅** `fef5745c`+fold `bfb1ca7a` (reviewer CHANGES: the **D-1 adversarial-verify catch** — the session-lived draft opened a DUPLICATE-ORDER path via sheet-swipe-over-success → fixed clear-first at the success outcome, test-pinned; also carried the Slice-A routed findings: `SnackbarController.bottomInset` shell lift + the 74pt FAB/ADR transcription fix → ratification T-0379; slide FEEL = owner device pass) | — | ios | no | — | booking-ux |

> | ID | Title | Size | Status | depends_on | Layers | sec | manual_step | Source |
> |----|-------|------|--------|-----------|--------|-----|-------------|--------|
> | **T-0375** | **Android BUG** — customer `home_hero_greeting` bakes the hardcoded name ", Michael" into EVERY user's greeting (`strings.xml:116`, ×5 locales; consumed `HomeTab.kt:489`; iOS deliberately shipped name-less). Fix name-less or a real placeholder | S | **proposed** (medium) | — | android | no | — | T-0373 Slice-F Gate-DP divergence (1) |
> | **T-0376** | **iOS partner pill-bar/pager parity** — the **ADR-0022 D4-mandated** follow-up (dedup-checked: not previously filed): Android partner HAS the pill (`FloatingIslandBottomBar.kt`) + `HorizontalPager`; iOS partner still ships the stock `TabView` (the ADR-recorded interim). Adopt D2/D3 with the partner pill variant (4 even slots, no FAB, no center gap) + harvest the shared pill to Core (the ≥2-call-sites rule) | M | **proposed** (medium) | — | ios | no | — | ADR-0022 D4 |
> | **T-0377** | **iOS launch-screen re-probe** — `UILaunchScreen` `UIImageName` on REAL hardware (known-broken on the 16.4 SIMULATOR: scaled-to-fill or silently blank; COLOR-ONLY shipped by T-0372; the in-app splash is branded, so the gap is one launch frame) | S | **proposed** (low) | — | ios | no | **owner: real-device probe** | T-0372 AC5 deviation |
> | **T-0378** | **iOS partner in-app splash branding** — partner `SplashGateView` is a bare `ProgressView`; the customer got the full branded splash (T-0372 AC5). Styling-only port; the fail-closed gate logic byte-untouched | S | **proposed** (low) | — | ios | no | — | T-0372 review-fold note |
> | **T-0379** | **Architect ratification** — (a) `fef5745c` ANNOTATED the accepted ADR-0022 body in place (the 74pt transcription correction) — ADRs are supersede-never-edit; ratify as a signed erratum or reverse into a proper supersede; (b) the T-0371 harvest (rode `e69a0283`) REPLACED the `patterns-mobile.md` SnackbarInsetState canonical-mapping row (view-local `bottomInset:` param → the published `SnackbarController.bottomInset` + pin-vs-follow) — a "one way" REDEFINITION to ratify. Dispatch BEFORE T-0376 (it cites both artifacts) | S | **proposed** (medium) | — | architect, docs | no | — | D+F review flags |
> | **T-0392** | **Mobile profile stats placeholder (iOS+Android)** — the customer Profile hero stats card ships hardcoded `3 bookings / 320 Kč saved / "Feb 2025" member-since / "Regular" tier` to EVERY user on BOTH platforms (`ProfileTab.kt:97-99`, iOS `ProfileStats.androidParity`); `"Feb 2025"` is also an untranslated English literal. No per-user source exists on the mobile contract (no `createdOn`, no savings, no orders VM on the tab). Wire bookings from the orders count, hide saved/member-since until a backend field lands (locale-format the date), reconcile `tier` to real membership — cross-platform to avoid drift | M | **proposed** (medium) | — | backend, ios, android | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-4 S3 review (major) |
> | **T-0393** | **Mobile home notifications inbox (iOS+Android)** — owner remark #7: the Home bell is a dead tap. Confirmed faithful parity — Android `onNotificationClick = {}` (`HomeTab.kt:228`) is a no-op too and no notifications-feed exists on either platform (only prefs toggles). Build a cross-platform inbox (or an interim "no notifications" empty-state sheet), decision-first; needs a mobile notifications-list endpoint if a real feed. **iOS interim empty-state sheet SHIPPED in fix-round 5** (owner re-flagged); Android still dead → mirror, then real feed | L | **proposed** (medium) — iOS interim done | — | analyst, backend, ios, android | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-4 owner remark #7 |
> | **T-0394** | **Backend: order-DETAIL snapshot carries no translations** — order-list localizes client-side (its DTOs carry `translations`), but `ServiceDetails`/`PackageDetails` on the order-detail projection do not, so order-detail service/package names render frozen-English in cs/sk/uk/ru. Add `translations` (or `serviceId` to re-localize, or server-side localize) to the order snapshot + wire both clients | M | **proposed** (medium) | — | backend, db, ios, android | no | spec re-dump + client regen | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-5 C-review (CASE b) |
> | **T-0395** | **Android: catalog-name localization parity** — iOS fix-round-5 localized Home "Popular packages" (`HomeTab.kt:915` raw `pkg.name`) + order-list summary (`OrdersTab.kt:521` raw `it.name`); Android has the `localizedName(translations,name)` helper (booking) but doesn't apply it on these two surfaces → English in non-English Android builds. Two call-site swaps | S | **proposed** (medium) | — | android | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-5 A+C reviews |
> | **T-0396** | **iOS token: `errorContainer` dark = blue** — `CleansiaColors.errorContainer` resolves to `Palette.sky800` (blue) in dark mode, so any destructive "container" surface is blue-on-dark. Fix-round-5 delete/dialog routed around it with `.error.opacity`; the token itself is a latent trap. Make the dark value an error-family red (architect owns palette) | S | **proposed** (low) | — | ios | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-5 D-review |
> | **T-0397** | **Architect: ratify fix-round-6 patterns harvest** — two new `patterns-mobile.md` "one way" rows (full-bleed header-to-top via GeometryReader + `.ignoresSafeArea(.container,.top)` + threaded top-inset; self-sizing short-entry-sheet detent) need Architect sign-off per the reviewer charter. Header idiom verified on-sim in the fix-round-6 fold; keep the mascot factual correction | S | **proposed** (low) | — | architect, ios, docs | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-6 B/C/D reviews |
> | **T-0398** | **iOS customer device registration not wired (+ APNs-gated)** — the customer app constructs NONE of the Core Push stack (partner has registrar+observer+client+startPush+delegate; customer has zero), so the install never POSTs Device/Register and the owner's Devices page is genuinely empty (page code verified correct; regression test pins empty≠error). Even wired, registration is APNs-token-gated = paid Apple account (T-0342/T-0344). Wire the stack like partner + decide tokenless registration so Devices works pre-APNs | M | **proposed** (medium) | T-0342 | ios | no | owner: paid Apple Program + APNs key | phase/ios-fix2 fix-round-8 slice E |
> | **T-0405** | **Security: revoked device keeps API access up to 24 h** — revocation IS wired (RevokeDevice deactivates + `RevokeByDeviceAsync` kills the device's refresh tokens, tested), but `AccessTokenExpMinutes=1440` on every host and NO per-request device/session check → the outstanding JWT works until natural expiry. Architect picks: shorten TTL to 15–60 min (recommended, config-only) / per-request check / push-driven force-logout (needs T-0404 infra). Owner-observed: revoked iPhone from sim, iPhone stayed in | S | **done ✅** `c198a275` (**ADR-0024 accepted**: 30 min on the two mobile hosts ONLY, config-only; web sessions carry no DeviceId → separate follow-up T-0409; pins: raw-file config test red-proven at 1440 + real-host 3s-TTL expiry 401 + revoked-A/sibling-B Postgres integration; reviewer APPROVE on own runs) | — | architect, backend | yes | — | owner report + revoke-session audit (wf_88de1ca0) |
> | **T-0406** | **Android partner: no forced-signout collector** — AuthAuthenticator emits ForcedSignOut on refresh failure and customer's NavHost routes to SignIn, but the partner app never collects `SessionManager.events` → token-dead partner UI stays on screen until cold start. Mirror the customer collector (iOS is correct in both apps) | S | **done ✅** `26d2d6df` (SessionViewModel + nav-root collector; review hardening made ALL sign-out navigations graph-clearing, closing a mid-logout [Login,Login] back-stack race; 54/54; reviewer APPROVE after 1 fix round) | — | android | no | — | revoke-session audit byproduct |
> | **T-0404** | **iOS order-status pushes never surface** — after registration works, iOS still shows nothing: the backend sends **data-only** FCM (`FcmPushDispatcher.cs:64` — no `Notification`/`Apns`/`content-available`) and lets clients render locally (Android does; **iOS has NO receive-side** — no data-message handler, NSE, or `UIBackgroundModes`), and data-only FCM doesn't wake/display on iOS. Architect picks per-platform APNs alert (recommended) vs iOS NSE + ADR on the no-PII trade-off; then backend apns block + iOS tap→deep-link. Found by the push-chain adversarial audit | M | **code done ✅** `e956529e`+`d937de0f` (**ADR-0025 accepted**: loc-key APNs alert via pure FcmMessageFactory, 12-event map, {orderNumber,count} allowlist, Android byte-pinned, 36 red-proven tests; both iOS catalogs +24 keys ×5 locales + customer tap trio incl. membership/loyalty Android-parity routes; reviewers APPROVE ×2). **REMAINING: Mac lane** (xcodegen + both test schemes + device matrix — a Firebase-console test push is a FALSE positive; real events only) + **D5 release-train gate**: the Functions deploy activating the map must NOT precede the first catalog-carrying public build of both apps; delivery still needs T-0403 (FCM tokens) + the Firebase credential (push runbook §0) | T-0403 | architect, backend, ios | yes | — | phase/ios-fix3 push-chain audit (wf_a1afcd54) |
> | **T-0403** | **iOS Firebase Messaging / FCM-token integration** — the backend dispatches via FCM (needs FCM registration tokens) but the iOS apps have NO Firebase SDK and register a RAW APNs token FCM can't target, so iOS push cannot deliver even with the APNs key uploaded. Add FirebaseCore+Messaging (both apps) + GoogleService-Info.plist, register the FCM token instead of raw APNs, and fold the T-0398 customer push wiring. Depends on T-0342 (owner APNs key). **HIGH** | M | **done ✅** (`bb30cd1f` integration + `22bb7beb` the didFinishLaunching call-site fix that actually made it register — deferred-register was silently dropped by iOS; owner-confirmed on a real device. Delivery still needs the Functions Firebase credential + T-0404 display) | T-0342 | ios | no | owner plists dropped ✅ | phase/ios-fix3 push-enablement investigation |
> | **T-0402** | **Partner order-detail DTO carries no translations** — the T-0394 analogue for the PARTNER app: `ServiceDetails`/`PackageDetails` lack `translations`, so partner order-detail service/package names render frozen-English in cs/sk/uk/ru. Add `translations` + mapper + spec re-dump + partner client regen + wire `ScopeCard`; historical orders degrade to snapshot English | M | **backend half done ✅** `bcd375d5` — PREMISE SUPERSEDED: the shared DTO has carried translations since T-0394; the partner WIRE already emits them (reviewer traced both partner hosts to the shared mapper, no bypass). What's stale: `partner-mobile-api.json` + all three partner clients. Employee-caller + degradation pins added (2/2). **REMAINING:** partner-mobile spec re-dump → Android/iOS partner client regen + `npm run generate-partner-client` → wire `ScopeCard`/mobile cards | — | backend, ios, android | no | partner spec re-dump + client regen | phase/ios-fix3 partner localization round |
> | **T-0401** | **Backend: overlap check ignores status → false time_conflicts** — `HasOverlappingOrderAsync` (OrderRepository.cs:216) counts ALL assigned orders in the window regardless of status, so stale/blocked/past orders reject takes with `order.time_conflict` (hit empirically by the round-9 gate on dev). Count only real future/active work (status-set decision + tests) | S | **done ✅** `a415a3d2` (rule: non-terminal assigned orders block, Completed/Cancelled free the slot; persisted CurrentStatus with FAIL-CLOSED null-fallback — excluding NULL would double-book; 11 red-proven tests; catalog carve-out architect-ratified; NOTE: real enum has OnTheWay=3, root CLAUDE.md lifecycle corrected) | — | backend, db | no | — | phase/ios-fix3 round-9 gate finding |
> | **T-0400** | **Deployed web cookie auth needs same-site custom domains** — SameSite=Strict cookies cannot cross the Azure default hostnames (all PSL-separated), so deployed-dev web auth is impossible by design; owner chose the shipped local devremote proxy for dev (no SWA Standard spend). This ticket = the enabler for ANY deployed web URL: cleansia.cz subdomains per env (bicep customDomains + certs + DNS) then same-site cookies just work; prod appsettings already assume this shape | M | **enabler done ✅** `6cc6b39e` (default-off `customDomains` param: binding→managed-cert→SNI in one deploy, SWA domains, auto CORS/base-URL alignment; naming table + owner runbook AZURE-DEV-RUNBOOK §12; reviewer APPROVE). **GATES:** owner DNS (CNAME+asuid TXT per host, apex A for prod) + Google OAuth origins; a POPULATED-map `what-if` must pass before uncommenting any param block. **Residuals:** AC1 architect — admin prod auth targets api.cleansia.cz whose committed CorsOrigins lacks admin.cleansia.cz; AC3 frontend — deployed-dev web build config targeting the *.dev.cleansia.cz API origins | — | architect, backend, frontend | yes | owner: DNS + Google OAuth origins | phase/web-fix1 root cause + owner decision |
> | **T-0399** | **Android partner: null birthDate vs required DateOnly** — `PersonalSectionViewModel.kt:115` sends `birthDate.takeIf { isNotBlank() }` (null when blank) against the backend's REQUIRED `DateOnly` (`UpdatePersonalInfo.cs:38-42`) → the same opaque `validation.invalid_date` the owner hit on iOS, for any partner without a stored birth date. Android has the field UI but no required check; add the inline required error before save (mirror the iOS fix + firstName/lastName checks) | S | **done ✅** `caef1854` (inline required error before save mirroring the shipped iOS fix; null no longer reaches the wire; key in all 5 locales; 69/69) | — | android | no | — | phase/ios-fix2 iOS partner birth-date fix |
> | **T-0407** | **Security: password change revokes NO sessions** — `ChangePassword.cs` rotates the hash but leaves every refresh token + outstanding JWT alive; device revoke is currently the account holder's only kill switch. Revoke all (or all-other) refresh tokens on password change + tests | S | **done ✅** `7a0daabf` (change→revoke all-OTHER sparing the caller via cookie; reset→revoke ALL; atomic with the hash; 1855 unit +2 Postgres proofs; reviewer APPROVE). **owner manual_step: nswag-regen (admin client — ChangeOwnPassword.Command gained CurrentRefreshToken, additive)** | — | backend | yes | — | ADR-0024 panel challenge (D4.6) |
> | **T-0408** | **Mobile clients conflate transport failure/429 with refresh rejection** — Android `AuthAuthenticator.kt:75-87` catch(Throwable)→sign-out; iOS `Auth.swift:221-239` nil on network.unreachable→forced sign-out. With 30-min TTL (ADR-0024) refresh events ×48/day: a synchronized wake of ~10 co-located devices can trip the anonymous 10/min/IP auth bucket and force-sign-out the overflow. Classify retryable (timeout/5xx/429) vs terminal (401/invalid_grant); URGENCY TRIGGER: forced-signout complaints or the D8 counter spiking post-TTL-rollout | M | **done ✅** `3e2d4447` (one cross-platform rule: terminal=401/403/parseable-reject, retryable=transport/5xx/429/unknown fail-open; conflation now uncompilable; android core 54 + partner 69 + customer 221; iOS Mac-deferred; reviewers APPROVE ×2 → hardening folded to T-0415) | — | android, ios | yes | — | ADR-0024 panel challenge C3 |
> | **T-0409** | **Web/admin access-token TTL follow-up** — web hosts stay at 1440 min (structurally unrevocable by device — no web client sends X-Device-Id). ADR-0024 ruling: the ADMIN host is the priority, separable case (SPA, short TTL viable today); customer-SSR needs its rotating-cookie refresh path verified first; interacts with T-0400 custom domains | M | **proposed** (medium) | — | architect, backend | yes | — | ADR-0024 amendment A3 |
> | **T-0410** | **Token-minting time hygiene** — `TokenService.cs:74` and `RefreshToken.cs:125` mint from raw `DateTime.UtcNow` (duplicated); migrate to `TimeProvider` so expiry boundaries become testable without real waits | S | **proposed** (low) | — | backend | no | — | ADR-0024 panel C5 |
> | **T-0411** | **Android partner: UserProfileStore survives forced sign-out** — the `SessionScopedCache` multibinding wipes only PushTokenRepository + NotificationFeedCache (`NotificationsModule.kt:74-79`); authenticator-driven sign-out leaves the prior user's profile (incl. `employeeId`, reused at `AuthRepository.kt:258`) on device — cross-user local-state bleed on shared devices. Add UserProfileStore to the multibinding | S | **done ✅** `caef1854` (UserProfileStore + customer UserRepository join the session-wipe set; redundant explicit clear removed; 69/69 + 221/221; reviewer APPROVE — the class is NOT fully closed, stragglers → T-0416) | — | android | yes | — | T-0406 review carry-over |
> | **T-0412** | **promo.new_sitewide display on iOS** — deliberately OUT of the ADR-0025 loc-key map (no fixed template exists; Android renders server-authored title/body from the wire).

> | **T-0413** | **ResolveDispute refund push lacks orderNumber** — the alert body renders with an empty arg (tolerated by design). `DisputeRepository.GetForUpdateAsync` has no `.Include(d => d.Order)`, so the producer can't read `DisplayOrderNumber` without a repo/query change | S | **done ✅** `c654a392` (read-only Order Include, caller-audited; DisplayOrderNumber resolved after the refund succeeds, degrades to empty on missing nav; 1847→; reviewer APPROVE, red reproduced at clean HEAD) | — | backend, db | no | — | T-0404 backend lane skip note |

Extend: drop the reset'd user's devices into the RevokedDeviceDirectory (user-keyed entries), or a userId-scoped iat cutoff. Needs its own short ADR (pre-analyzed in ADR-0026 CH-13) | M | **done ✅** `f7c89d5e` (**ADR-0027 accepted**: sibling RevokedUserDirectory keyed on userId, reuses T-0407 password_reset rows — zero migration; keys on sub so no claim-transition; RESET only, same-second self-heals; GroupBy+MAX proven on real Postgres; RED-proven by reviewer; web untouched; 1899/75/108) | T-0414 | architect, backend | yes | — | ADR-0026 X1 |
> | **T-0419** | **RefreshToken rotation↔revoke TOCTOU (ADR-0026 X2/D9.7)** — a rotation racing a revoke's read→commit window escapes the chain and then passes the directory (its iat postdates the revoke), invisible in the Devices list.

Fix: `xmin` concurrency token on RefreshToken (no migration) and/or set-based conditional revocation | S | **done ✅** `ffc0d19a` (xmin optimistic-concurrency token on RefreshToken, no migration; all 4 revoke paths retry-on-conflict RE-READ so a rotation-inserted child is caught — airtight kill switch, stronger than last-writer-wins; reviewer caught+fixed a blocker where xmin 500-d the revoke paths; red-proven maxAttempts=1). **owner: EF model-snapshot regen (schema-empty)**.

> | **T-0421** | **Revocation exhaustion + theft-chain edges (T-0419 review non-blocking)** — (a) after 5 consecutive xmin collisions on the same rows the revoke retry helper propagates the exception → 500 + rollback = technically fail-OPEN for a kill switch; add a final bulk ExecuteUpdate revoke that ignores concurrency for strict fail-closed semantics; (b) CommitStagedChainRevokeWithRetryAsync re-revokes only ex.Entries (not a full re-read like the other paths), so a legit rotation of a DIFFERENT token racing a theft-chain revoke can leave its new child alive — pre-existing (pre-xmin it also survived), bounded by the ≤30s directory/TTL; make it re-read for parity | S | **proposed** (low) | — | backend | yes | — | T-0419 review notes 4/theft-chain |
> | **T-0422** | **Self-revoke should sign out the CURRENT device instantly** — deleting YOUR OWN device from the Devices page leaves a brief zombie session until ADR-0026's ≤30s directory catches it; the client already knows it revoked its own deviceId, so it can sign out at 0s. Client-side complement to T-0414: on a successful revoke where revoked deviceId == local deviceId, run local sign-out + route to login; badge "This device" + confirm copy.

> **iOS Phase 0 (the foundation behind T-0296…T-0301 + the T-0302 codegen *wiring*) is implemented,
> committed, and MAC-VERIFIED this session, and the iOS CI gate (T-0323) is merged.** The foundation was
> authored earlier on Windows; this session **compile-verified + fixed it on a Mac** (Xcode 26.3, iOS-16
> simulator): **CleansiaCore builds + all 68 unit tests pass on the simulator; both app schemes
> (`CleansiaPartner`/`CleansiaCustomer`) build AND launch in the simulator; `swiftlint --strict` +
> `swiftformat --lint` are both clean.** A launch-crash blocker (`API_BASE_URL` never reaching
> `Info.plist` → `fatalError`) was **found, fixed, and proven by launching the app** — NOT tracked open
> (audit `audits/AUDIT-2026-06-26-ios-phase0-foundation.md`). **Merged:** `8220f4c` "ci: add iOS
> build/test/lint workflow (macOS runner) (#90)" + `6628172` "Fix/ios phase0 verification (#91)"

> root), T-0299 (snackbar/error center), T-0300 (auth/session/header spine — 68 CleansiaCore tests green),
> T-0301 (header-parity spec doc). **T-0323 done via CI** (`.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`, **#90** —
> macOS, path-filtered `src/cleansia_ios/**`, **BLOCKING** `swiftformat --lint` + `swiftlint lint
> --strict`, then build+test CleansiaCore + both schemes on a simulator). **T-0302 DONE** — the codegen

| ID | Title | Size | Status | depends_on | Layers | sec | manual_step | Source |
|----|-------|------|--------|-----------|--------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **T-0354** | **Backend (money)** — the refund RE-DRIVE branch skips the refundable-ceiling recheck: `RefundService.cs:50-56` re-drives a Pending/Failed row's frozen amount without re-reading `TotalPrice - consumed`; RefundKeys are per-purpose so a cross-key sequence (Pending cancel + Succeeded admin refund + retry) can over-refund. Clamp/fail the re-drive against the live ceiling + a characterization test (the existing re-drive test arranges `ArrangeConsumed(0m)` — the gap is untested) | S | **proposed** (CONFIRMED by adversarial verify) | — | backend | **yes** | — | Codebase audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0355** | **Backend (money, 1-cent class)** — customer cancellation refund is unrounded and Stripe TRUNCATES: `CancelOrder.cs:113` `TotalPrice * (1 - feeRate)` (3-4 dp reachable), `StripeClient.cs:93/111` `(long)(amount * 100)` truncates toward zero, while `Refund.Amount` persists `numeric(18,2)` rounded — the ledger and Stripe can differ by 1 cent, feeding the Refunded/PartiallyRefunded comparison. `Math.Round(…, 2, AwayFromZero)` at the source + a truncation-boundary test | S | **proposed** (CONFIRMED) | — | backend | no | — | Codebase audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0356** | **Backend (defense-in-depth)** — the CSRF token is a stable per-user HMAC that never rotates: no issuer ever emits a `jti` claim, so `CsrfTokenService.GetSessionKey` always falls back to the user id (its own docstring promises per-jti rotation). Emit `jti` in `SetClaims`/both token issuers + key the CSRF derivation off it (the fallback code already exists); update `AuthCookieConfig.SessionKeyForCsrf` | S | **proposed** (CONFIRMED, low — SameSite=Strict is the primary control) | — | backend | **yes** | — | Codebase audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0357** | **Backend+infra** — `/health` is liveness-only (`AddCheck("self")` → 200 while Postgres/Storage are dead), so App Service never recycles a broken instance. Split liveness (`/alive`) from readiness: `AddDbContextCheck<CleansiaDbContext>` + a light blob check on `/health`, keep `healthCheckPath` pointed at readiness | M | **proposed** | — | backend | no | — | Infra audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0358** | **CI cost/speed** — every master push full-rebuilds both stacks: no NuGet cache, `--skip-nx-cache` on all 3 Angular builds, migrate-database re-restores the whole solution for the EF bundle, no path filters (a docs-only push runs the full Azure deploy). Cache NuGet + Nx, artifact-reuse the bundle, add path filters — now ONE place to fix (deploy-azure.yml) | M | **proposed** | — | backend | no | — | Infra audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0359** | **Prod reliability seam (pre-go-live)** — author the prod posture the dev Bicep deliberately skips: deployment slots + swap (S1 supports them; drop any stop/start), Postgres `highAvailability`/`geoRedundantBackup` params (env-switched), autoscale rule, ACR retention (images accumulate one per sha forever), App Insights sampling ratio + prod ingestion cap, and the VNet/private-endpoint seam for Postgres+Storage (Q-INFRA-03; the 0.0.0.0 Azure-services rule is dev-accepted only) | L | **proposed** | — | architect, backend | **yes** | — | Infra audit 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0360** | **Infra (observability)** — poison-queue depth alert: needs storage diagnostic settings + a scheduled-query rule over the queue logs; deliberately deferred out of `alerts.bicep` (which exports `actionGroupId` for exactly this attachment) | S | **proposed** | — | backend | no | — | alerts lane 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0361** | **Backend (tenant residual)** — `EmployeeRepository.GetByUserEmailAsync` is tenant-filtered but called on ANONYMOUS login (`TokenService.cs:60`) and refresh (`RefreshToken.cs:97`): a tenant-stamped EMPLOYEE gets a JWT **missing `employee_id`** — the same bug class the `e406584f` fix closed for User reads, left open because the file was outside that lane. Mirror the tenant-ignoring anonymous-path pattern + extend the pin test | S | **proposed** | — | backend | **yes** | — | tenant lane residual 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0362** | **Backend (latent money trap)** — `OrderEmployeePay.AddBonus/AddDeduction/UpdatePay` recompute `TotalPay` WITHOUT re-applying the min/max clamp (dead code today; the moment an admin adjust-pay feature wires them, the clamped base silently un-clamps). Re-apply the clamp inside the mutators + tests | S | **proposed** | — | backend | no | — | invoice lane residual 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0363** | **Clients: send email with the 6-digit confirm code** (after `be087ae3` the OTP branch REQUIRES email; Android-customer already sends it) — (a) web customer+partner confirm-email facades pass the email after the NSwag regen; (b) Android partner after the mobile-partner OpenAPI spec regen (`ConfirmUserEmailCommand` is a generated model; thread `state.email` in `AuthRepository.confirmEmail` + the VM); (c) iOS parity on the Mac. Until each client sends email, its confirm of NEW codes fails validation (old long-token emails unaffected) | S | **partial ✅ — customer web done** `44cf8c99` (register + unconfirmed-login carry the email via query param; direct navigation renders an email input, key in all 5 locales; ALSO fixed the auth service importing the PARTNER client's code-only command — would have silently dropped email on the wire — and resend sending undefined on direct nav; facade spec red-proven, 8/8; SSR AOT build green). iOS done earlier `09901f29`. **Partner halves done after the owner regen (2026-07-07):** partner WEB `6572ed4a` (mirror of the customer fix; also fixed resend-undefined on direct nav + a latent forever-disabled resend button; spec red-proven 7/7; partner AOT build green) and Android PARTNER `f73bf472` (repo+VM thread the persisted unconfirmed-login email with a blank guard; new VM test; 52/52 with codegen from the regenerated spec) — **ALL FOUR CLIENTS NOW SEND {code, email}; ticket CLOSED** (residual: iOS suites still run on the Mac only) | — | frontend, android, ios | **yes** | — | OTP fix `be087ae3` |
| **T-0364** | **Backend (ADR-0010 revision, OWNER DECISION pending)** — `SendEmailHandler` claims idempotency BEFORE the send (at-most-once): any send that fails after the claim is PERMANENTLY lost on retry (bit during the broken-config window). Proposal: claim AFTER the successful send for the email consumer (a rare duplicate email beats a lost confirmation); keep claim-before-act where the effect is not safely repeatable | S | **done ✅** `fd0a9d40` (owner APPROVED 2026-07-08; **ADR-0023** ratifies the per-consumer claim-ordering rule, partially supersedes ADR-0010 header-pointer-only; email consumer now check→send→claim with two additive guard members HasProcessedAsync/MarkProcessedAsync; push + AlreadyProcessedAsync byte-unchanged — push→Mode B would need its own ruling; failed-send-retries + claim-failure-acks red-proven; suite 1776/1776; reviewer: only 2 doc-wording minors, fixed in-commit) | — | architect, backend | **yes** | — | SendEmail incident 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0365** | **Architect (multi-tenant activation pack)** — the decisions the tenant fixes deliberately did NOT make: registration semantics under the composite `(TenantId, Email)` unique index (same email in two tenants → anonymous email-keyed login/reset resolve nondeterministically and `RecordFailedLoginAsync` hits ALL rows), host/subdomain tenant-resolution middleware for anonymous requests, and whether confirm-family lookups stay filtered. Blocks multi-tenant go-live; single-tenant behavior is unaffected today | M | **proposed** | — | architect, backend | **yes** | — | tenant lane mustTell 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0366** | **i18n gap on BOTH mobile platforms** — 144 of the 250 `BusinessErrorMessage` keys have NO `error_*` string resource in either Android app (grep-verified: the whole `promo.*`, `membership.*`, `recurring_booking.*` families + `referral.not_accepted/not_qualified/reason_required`), so Android AND the new iOS localizer show the raw key. Translate the user-reachable subset ×5 locales in the Android apps + harvest into the iOS Core catalog (same pipeline as the 106 done). Also: 3 iOS entries were hand-translated (`snackbar.dismiss`, `error.not_found`, `error.request` cs/sk/uk/ru) — owner translation review | M | **proposed** | — | android, ios | no | **owner: review the 3 hand-translated entries** | iOS error-l10n lane 2026-07-02 |
| **T-0367** | **iOS residual** — `ApiError.fromGenerated` (`CustomerGeneratedError.swift:6`, `PartnerDashboardClient.swift:25`) maps most GENERATED-client failures with `code: nil` + the raw body as message, bypassing the new key-based localizer (only paths routed through `ProblemDetailsError.map` get catalog lookups). Route the generated-client error mapping through the shared ProblemDetails parse so booking/disputes/earnings errors localize too | S | **ABSORBED → T-0370 ✅ done** (2026-07-03 — phase/ios-fix1 Slice C carried this exact fix; landed in `5252bfb9`, T-0370 done at phase close) | — | ios | no | — | iOS error-l10n lane 2026-07-02 |

Admin-host-only refund surface → latent, not a live breach | M | **done ✅** `64f6525` (HARDENING-1, off master `3e7ce52`; backend trio with T-0346+T-0350. `RefundPaymentIntentAsync` on `IStripeClient`/`StripeClient`; `RefundService` routes by charge surface (Session→web XOR `StripePaymentIntentId`→mobile); **NO schema change** (`StripePaymentIntentId` already existed). Money-correctness fold-in: extended the refundable-surface gate to the two CANCEL paths via `Order.HasRefundableChargeSurface` so a cancelled paid mobile/recurring card order refunds.

>     draft, sprint 8; behavior-preserving, non-blocking).
>   - **T-0271** (Phase-0 E2E smoke — customer **booking → checkout-intent** critical path in a real
>     browser, run in seeded CI; M, `[frontend]`+`[backend]`, **ready**, sprint 8). **Closes the no-E2E

>     only the scaffold `example.spec.ts`; this is the thin "decide the E2E layer early" smoke (one
>     spec + CI seed/boot wiring, no new framework), expandable later.
> - **Every other follow-up is `done`:** T-0263 (admin failed-PDF render — the owner's
>   admin nswag-regen WAS confirmed and the frontend half shipped: 34/34 + 12/12 green; Q-W3-3 now

> - **Standing OWNER items (PM never runs these):** the two ops tasks — **Mapbox key rotation** +

>   ef-migrations: T-0261 UserMembership index + T-0237 catalog FK → in PROD apply the new indexes

> i18n). T-0238 shipped its backend DTO fields in Wave 6; the frontend AC is **blocked on the owner's

Masked today (web Checkout is single-tenant, `TenantId==null`). Fix: tenant-ignoring existence check + non-null-tenant integration test.

Reproduced live on the Mobile partner host with tenant-consistent seed data.

> All 3 gating ADRs accepted (0001 authz, 0002 outbox, 0003 ratelimit). All `draft` → PM promotes to

> **Consistency canonicalization backlog** (from `audits/consistency-violations.md`). These are

> First real job (pending owner approval of this setup): **a full codebase audit** across all
> layers — backend, db, frontend, android — to surface functional gaps, half-built features,
> spaghetti hotspots, hardcoded strings, security holes, and performance issues. The audit fans out
> one analyst + one reviewer (and `security`/`optimizer` where relevant) per subsystem in parallel,
> writes findings to `agents/backlog/audits/`, and the PM converts each finding into a ranked ticket
> here. See `agents/WAY-OF-WORKING.md`.
