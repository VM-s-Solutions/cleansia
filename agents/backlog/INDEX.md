> ## 🏁 ALL WAVES (0–7) COMPLETE — the entire audit-driven program backlog is DONE (2026-06-21)
> **Every ticketed wave is closed.** Waves 0–6 + the T-0197 mobile slice + T-0264/T-0265 are merged to
> `master` (tip `b9e91cd8`, PR #81). **Wave 7 (Android consistency debt) is now COMPLETE** — 4 tickets
> done, committed + pushed (`9c1989e4`) on `feature/wave7-android-consistency`; PR to `master` is the
> owner's call (PM never merges). The **consistency audit (`audits/consistency-violations.md`) is
> essentially fully resolved** — all backend (F1–F8), frontend (F10–F12), and Android §E rules
> (E1/E2/E5/E6/E7) closed.
>
> **What remains across the WHOLE program — TWO open engineering follow-ups + standing owner items:**
> - **Engineering follow-ups (the open tickets):**
>   - **T-0270** (E2 residual — 3 post-Wave-5 one-shot-action VMs onto `ActionState`; S, `[android]`,
>     draft, sprint 8; behavior-preserving, non-blocking).
>   - **T-0271** (Phase-0 E2E smoke — customer **booking → checkout-intent** critical path in a real
>     browser, run in seeded CI; M, `[frontend]`+`[backend]`, **ready**, sprint 8). **Closes the no-E2E
>     gap** a retrospective surfaced: unit/integration/host tests cover the API seams but **nothing**
>     verified the rendered customer journey end-to-end — a dead CTA / broken route / wizard step that
>     won't advance is invisible to API-level tests. The Nx Playwright harness already exists but holds
>     only the scaffold `example.spec.ts`; this is the thin "decide the E2E layer early" smoke (one
>     spec + CI seed/boot wiring, no new framework), expandable later.
> - **Every other follow-up is `done`:** T-0263 (admin failed-PDF render — the owner's
>   admin nswag-regen WAS confirmed and the frontend half shipped: 34/34 + 12/12 green; Q-W3-3 now
>   reconciled-closed), T-0264 (vestigial locale keys), T-0265 (Android email-validation test-env gap —
>   why the partner suite is green on plain JVM) are all **`done`** on `master`/the Wave-7 branch.
> - **Standing OWNER items (PM never runs these):** the two ops tasks — **Mapbox key rotation** +
>   **Functions app restart**; the queued **owner manual steps** still pending merge/apply (the Wave-6
>   ef-migrations: T-0261 UserMembership index + T-0237 catalog FK → in PROD apply the new indexes
>   `CONCURRENTLY` by hand; and the two open PRs to `master`); and the **optional product / external-config
>   items** (IMP-1 Google OAuth needs a Google Cloud project; BUG-22 email-badge CSS). Full consolidated
>   owner list: `status/sprint-9.md` §close-out.

> ## ✅ WAVE 7 COMPLETE — Android consistency debt (deferred E1/E2/E6/E7) (closed 2026-06-21)
> **Wave 7 is COMPLETE — all work committed + pushed on `feature/wave7-android-consistency` (`9c1989e4`).**
> PR to `master` is the owner's call (PM never merges). It cleared the **last** engineering debt: the
> deferred Android consistency-sweep rules **E1/E2/E6/E7** filed STILL-OPEN in
> `audits/consistency-violations.md` (F13/F14/F15/F16). T-0197 had closed **E5/ApiResult** only. All four
> were **Android-only, mobile-only, behavior-preserving** — no go-live / money / correctness impact. **No
> new ADR** (E5/E7 ratified by ADR-0011; E1/E2/E6 are §E rules). **No deliberation panel** (each a
> mechanical canonicalization against a ratified rule → one-line no-decision note). Plan + execution
> lanes + the E6 real-vs-raw count: **`status/sprint-9.md`**.
>
> **Orchestrator-verified on the real Android tree:** `:core` + partner-app + customer-app **all compile**;
> **partner-app 37/37** (was 26 — T-0267 added 11 E1 characterization tests), **customer-app 201/201**,
> **`:core` 13/13**; **92 changed files encoding-clean**; the **E6 re-grep confirms only the scoped
> exclusions remain** (Singleton-repo flows, the 2 NavHosts, `:core` `GlobalSnackbarHost`).
>
> **DONE (4):** **T-0266** (E7 — partner dir/naming collapsed to inline-singular `features/<name>/`; pure
> move + package/import rewrite, 0 body diffs; `Details`→`Detail` singular rename) · **T-0267** (E1 —
> residual partner page-state flag-bags `InvoiceDetailsViewModel` + `OrderPhotosViewModel` → sealed
> `*UiState`; +11 characterization tests) · **T-0268** (E2 — **verify-and-close, NO production edits**;
> the audit-named F14 set confirmed canonical on the shared `ActionState`, F14 cleared — **surfaced 3
> genuine post-Wave-5 E2 residuals → carried as T-0270**) · **T-0269** (E6 —
> `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` sweep over the filtered ≈56 screen/VM-flow collections across both apps).
>
> **Audit closed:** `audits/consistency-violations.md` — **F13 (E1), F14 (E2), F15 (E6), F16-E7
> RESOLVED**; F14 carries the **small T-0270 residual**. The consistency sweep is essentially complete.
>
> **NEW follow-up filed:** **T-0270** (S, `[android]`, draft, sprint 8) — convert the 3 one-shot-action
> VMs that postdate T-0252 (`CreateRecurringViewModel`, `DisputeDetailViewModel`, `DeleteAccountViewModel`)
> off loose `_submitting`/`_loading` booleans onto the shared `ActionState` + `SharedFlow` pattern.
> Behavior-preserving. The per-row/per-button in-flight discriminators
> (`OrderDetailsViewModel._inFlightAction`, `OrdersListViewModel.inFlightActionOrderId`,
> `RecurringBookingsViewModel._mutating`) are **recorded NON-violations** (a single `ActionState` can't
> express which-row/which-button) — **NOT** in T-0270's scope.

> **25 of 26 reconciled `done ✅`** in the table below (the ticket files still read `draft`/`in-review`;
> PM reconciled status here, INDEX-side only, per the Wave-2 convention — no history rewrite).
> **EXCEPTION: T-0179 was NOT built** — verified: `CreateMembershipSubscription.cs` untouched since Wave 1,

> owner applies the Users lockout ef-migration and `Cleansia.IntegrationTests` runs green.
> **Owner steps PENDING:** ef-migration (4 additive `Users` lockout columns) + nswag-regen (customer

Reproduced live on the Mobile partner host with tenant-consistent seed data.

> All 3 gating ADRs accepted (0001 authz, 0002 outbox, 0003 ratelimit). All `draft` → PM promotes to

> **Consistency canonicalization backlog** (from `audits/consistency-violations.md`). These are
> `draft` until the owner approves the setup and the PM promotes them to `ready`. Each maps to a rule
> in `knowledge/consistency.md`. Two (T-0009, T-0016) need an Architect ADR first because they are
> cross-cutting (soft-delete; mobile repo contract) — do not start those without the ADR.

> First real job (pending owner approval of this setup): **a full codebase audit** across all
> layers — backend, db, frontend, android — to surface functional gaps, half-built features,
> spaghetti hotspots, hardcoded strings, security holes, and performance issues. The audit fans out
> one analyst + one reviewer (and `security`/`optimizer` where relevant) per subsystem in parallel,
> writes findings to `agents/backlog/audits/`, and the PM converts each finding into a ranked ticket
> here. See `agents/WAY-OF-WORKING.md`.
