# End-to-end tests

The platform tested end to end on **DEV**, by role, from the case catalogue in `cases/`. **Never against PRO.**

## Layout

- `cases/<flow>.md`: the catalogue, one file per page of `docs/flows/`. Every case cites the rule it checks.
- `runbooks/`: how an agent drives each mobile app, on the iOS simulator with AXe and on the Android emulator with adb.
- `runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>/findings.md`: the triaged findings register of one run.
- The runnable suite for the APIs and the web apps: `src/Cleansia.App/apps/cleansia-platform-e2e` (Playwright).

## The roles

| Role | Signs in as | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `e2e.<run>.customer@example.com` | customer web, customer API, customer mobile API, customer iOS and Android apps |
| Guest | nobody | customer web without an account |
| Cleaner | `e2e.<run>.cleaner@example.com` | partner web, partner API, partner mobile API, partner iOS and Android apps |
| Admin | the published DEV admin (README.md) | admin web, admin API |

The QA lead owns the catalogue and sequences a run. A failure becomes a finding only after the **triager** has
reproduced it and read `docs/` and the ADRs: each one is a *defect*, *by design*, a *test bug* or an *environment*
fault. Findings are reported, never fixed in the same pass.

## A case

```
### E2E-BOOK-007 — A cash booking needs a saved card
- **Priority:** P1 (a core journey) or P2
- **Role:** Customer
- **Surfaces:** API · Web · iOS · Android (only those the case truly runs on)
- **Rule:** → /flows/booking-and-pricing#cash — one line saying what the rule requires
- **Given** the state before. **When** the one action. **Then** what must be observed, exactly.
- **DEV:** what the case creates, how long it waits (a slot, a start window, the 02:00 UTC run), or why it cannot run on DEV
```

Ids are `E2E-<FLOW>-NNN`, numbered from 001 in each file and never reused: AUTH (auth and identity), BOOK (booking
and pricing), TAKE (offerability and take), EXEC (execution and completion), PAY (payment and fiscal), CANCEL
(cancellation, refund and dispute), PAYOUT (pay and payouts), LOYAL (loyalty and memberships), GDPR (GDPR and
audit), XCUT (cross-cutting).

An assertion is catalogued once, in the file whose flow page owns its rule. A case another file owns keeps its id
and heading, and its body is one line: `- **See** E2E-<FLOW>-NNN`.

## DEV facts a case must respect

- Bookings open at 07:00 UTC (08:00 Prague); a job can be started from 60 minutes before its slot.
- A pay period on DEV lasts 3 days and closes in the 02:00 UTC run after its end date; Close now ends it today.
- Stripe is in test mode: 4242 4242 4242 4242 pays, 4000 0000 0000 5126 pays and then fails any refund.
- E-mail goes to SendGrid and `@example.com` never receives it, so a test account is confirmed by the DEV-only
  `sql-scripts/dev-e2e-confirm-accounts.sql`, and no case can read an e-mail. That script is not written yet: sub-phase 1b
  writes it, and running it on DEV waits for the owner's OK. Until then every customer and cleaner P1 case after
  registration is blocked.
- The deployed admin web sits behind an Azure Static Web Apps gate: a browser run needs a Microsoft identity the
  owner has invited with the `admin_console` role (docs/admin-app/overview.md), which a role agent cannot get alone.
  Until the owner provides one, an admin case runs on the admin API and records its Web half as not run.
